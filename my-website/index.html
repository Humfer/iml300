        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/jcwong/sketches/rucFCTNy8">Harmful Unintended</a>
        <p>
            Harmful Unintended is an immersive narrative in which the player is presented with the words "Click" written someone's shirt. In order to progress through all the stages of the piece, you will have to complete each goal that is assigned to you. <b>Just do what you are told and you'll get through it easily.</b> These goals are supposed to be simple and visually stimulating so that you won't overthink why you are even doing them.
            <br>The progression of this experience is meant to reflect on the absence of choice you have at the start of the piece. Your only options are to just do or not do. By the end, you'll experience the consequences of your actions whether or not you wanted to pursue them. <br>
            Note: <br>-This piece is best experienced on p5 dark mode.<br>
            -All borrowed material is linked on a Google Doc sheet in the code.
