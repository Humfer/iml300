            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <p>I think it is interesting to see both how far back the history of computer art is and the gendered view of computer programming with it being characterized as a masculine activity while artistic talents were characterized as feminine activities. I think it is important to understand the evolution of computer art, from a machine that was programmed to plot lines to a fully-realized animation using computers, to facilitate the storytelling process and how women have pioneered many of these stepping-stones, especially with their hidden history of achievements. I really enjoyed Hiroshi Kawano's explanation of how artificial intelligence works. He explains that the role of the programmer is to properly instruct the computer on how to use its own toolkit to draw on independently. Kawano emphasizes the importance of seeing computers as artists rather than as a medium for art. This distinction of separate art forms focuses its weight on the new style of "scientific aesthetics'' in which the computer uses logic to create art that is aesthetically pleasing. I was fascinated by the outputs of images that Kawano's algorithms had created and contemplated what it means to have an artwork that is aesthetically pleasing.
                <br>
                <br>Questions:
                <br>How did the lack of art-specific programs influence the style of computer-generated art that was being created at the time?<br>
                How did the role of women affect the publicity of computer programming as an art form? <br>
                Is there a logic to art? <br>What does Hiroshi Kawano mean when he mentions how artificial intelligence comprehends the logic of aesthetics?

                Before reading, my concept of GUIs was just an interface designed to allow users to intuitively interact with a computer. In this way, the term "gooey" sounds less formal and abstract to daily users. But what I was missing from the concept of GUIs that this reading had informed me about is the many components to the creative process that influence our perception of normality. From its conception, old computer color designs codified the color white to represent the start and foundation of technology with black representing its end. Capitalism influenced the complexity and energy usage of computers through its encouragement of the simultaneous balance of customer affordability and profitability. Encapsulation left GUIs to be massively limiting in what the user could see versus the programmer. This culmination of factors in the design of GUIs created a culture of whiteness that reflects the desires of its white male creators and the exclusion of everyone else. The design of the black background and white text in the reading is reflective of the contents and sparks a movement to reverse the conventions of GUIs designed and created by rich white men that are ingrained into our perceptions of technology and to diversify the demands for UI of everyone.
                <br>
                <br>Questions:
                <br>
                How is the author’s use of the black background and white text indicative of the reading’s message on white culture?
                <br>
                Why would the author refer to GUIs with the word “gooey”?
                <br>
                What is the Black Gooey Universe?

                I found the idea of surveillance to be really creepy and fascinating at the same time. There seems to be an acceptance with society that, for the sake of convenience, we are willing to sacrifice privacy to a robot. Lauren McCarthy explores the perspective of this invasion by replicating the AI services with a human moderator. She presents two categories of public versus private life in her work surrounding surveillance. Technology has overridden the human instinct to maintain privacy through the use of smartphones that continuously track your location and smart devices such as Google Home and Alexa that record your home life for the sake of convenience. McCarthy first introduced the "Follower" project in which participants desire the secret eyes of another person to follow them around in public. For some reason, I find this type of following in public to be more disturbing than McCarthy's second project "Lauren." "Lauren" constantly oversees participants within the privacy of their home and controls their smart home through the participant's commands. There is a sense of comfort and intimacy that arises when we know that one person is always there to watch over us, and how they can be separated from our public life because we can leave them whenever we want. This is different from "Follower" in which the participants cannot separate from the viewer wherever they go, don't have an image, and cannot interact with them. But, the level of intrusiveness in public in "Follower" is less than it is in private in "Lauren." This false sense of comfort within a more intrusive aspect of our lives can be dangerous if this technology were to fall in the wrong hands. <br><br>
                Questions:<br>
                Do you think that society prefers surveillance from humans or AI?<br>

                Where is the limit of sacrificing privacy for convenience?<br>

                What is the appeal of knowing that a stranger is always watching you?

                It is quite interesting to read a scholarly article about the humor of today: memes. It really is as if this article is made for aliens to gain some insight as to how the American capitalist society has given value to communication through the circulation of poor images. In the digital age of torrenting and information overload, Americans and other people within highly developed countries have adapted to a system of efficiency and short attention spans. Because of this, we react in the form of images because they can hold a lot of information and context that our minds can instantly latch onto without the use of words. I think the referral of these pictures as "poor images" is very fitting as they are the derivative and out-of-context form of narrative cinema or documentation. Ironically, most poor images recontextualize the image to hold even more value to the original. <br><br>
                Questions:<br>
                Does a poor image hold more contemporary value than its older original?<br>

                Can poor images be considered copyright?
                <br>
                How does the distribution of poor images affect independent filmmakers?

            <p>
                I think algorithmic bias is a result of insufficient recognition of minorities in the developer space. The creators of the facial recognition software most likely did not intentionally exclude Black faces when testing the algorithm. However, it's faults in inclusive facial recognition are telling of the team that coded it. Often, in new emerging technologies, we see the presence of the ivory tower in which a single elite group has access to control all technological development. A lack of diversity in the developer community creates a cycle of bias in which computers are training users to be subconsciously favored and get accustomed to a white prototype. Buolamwini introduces this concept in a comedic manner, illustrating how something that can seem initially unimportant or just inconvenient is dangerous. I didn’t realize how powerful facial technology could be for policing and the judicial system. If there is a misconception that algorithms are not biased, we are going to rationalize prejudiced decisions such as a prison sentence length as being computed fairly by a computer.<br><br>
                Questions:<br>
                Is it possible for an algorithm to be not biased if they are all human created?<br>
                Why might this issue not be taken seriously?<br>
                In the future, do you think that people will even rely on computers to make large ethical decisions such as prison sentence length?<br>

            <h2>Week 6</h2>
            <p>
                The reading makes me wonder if I should have more purpose and intention when I create. I don't often consider what impact a work that is so personal to me has on others. When our work is so intimate and reflective of our identity, it is hard to understand how it can be perceived externally. Sometimes in my work, I try to push limits just for the sake of interest and doing so. I have never even thought about the environmental impacts we make when we collectively use so much electricity daily. In the presentation, we can see how a seemingly harmless work of literature can contribute to the perpetuation of associating happiness and civilization to only first-world countries. When we overvalue wealth as the determinant of happiness, we ignore the culture and lives of those who live in indigent or generally less-developed areas. <br><br>
                Questions: <br>
                Why is it important to have purpose within our code that is external to our own?
                <br>
                Which acknowledgement is most resonant to the current climate of the art economy?
                <br>
                How does popular literature socially influence the views of the younger generation?

            <h2>Week 7</h2>
            <p>
                This issue of solely designing for the people of today rather than for the world of tomorrow reminded me of a lot of the politics that I have been seeing on the news. Actions are being taken only to benefit the current economy and the efficiency of our nation. I am reminded of the Twin Pine Minerals project, a titanium mine that was able operate without federal oversight despite its endangerment to the Okefenokee Swamp. This endangerment of wildlife for the sake of domestic titanium production intended to strengthen the US supply chain against economic rivals such as China and Russia. The development in technology leading to globalization has created an emphasis of competition in media and has clouded our aspirations for a sustainable future. There is obvious difficulty in designing for others. Today’s hustle culture has left us absorbed in our own bubbles, attempting to be validated by a materialistic society. If we can design in a way that can appeal to both sustainability and efficiency, I think that more people will be willing to invest in sustainable designs. Unfortunately, sustainability and efficiency seem to conflict each other. <br><br>
                Questions:<br>
                How has today's hustle culture led us to prioritize the now over the future?<br>
                What are the negative effects of globalization?<br>
                How can we design a reward system that benefits everybody equally? <br>
