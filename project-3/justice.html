        <h1>Justice</h1>
        <p class="explanation">
            The late 1950s became a popular era for the Western genre. Movies, TV series and literature enacted depictions of early U.S. settlement – a time when fiction mythicized gun laws to be nonexistent. This absence, of course, was one of its selling factors. The Western film <i>Ride Beyond Vengeance</i> (1966) narrates the loner Jonas Trapp’s journey back to his former lover after ten years of buffalo hunting. At the movie's climax, Jonas gets into an intense saloon brawl against a man who had previously assaulted him and stolen his money. Most of this fight sequence utilizes objects within the saloon. The fight concludes, however, with Jonas pulling out his pistol to kill his opponent. Jonas, the morally upright lead, prevails in attaining justice by shooting his enemy. <br> <br>
            Similar to its other Western counterparts, <i>Ride Beyond Vengeance</i> is exalted with themes of personal vengeance and individualism which are customarily dispensed by gunfights. These values, enhanced by the righteous protagonist, situated Westerns as the ultimate bragging ground for Americans to take pride in their heavily mythicized history. Karen Stewart, professor of Media Studies at SUNY Oneonta, confirms that Westerns gave viewers “a moralistic high ground where they knew their shared concept of social virtue would prevail” (Stewart). Fast draws, another mythicized trope in Westerns, introduced the narrative of civil gunfights. Opponents settled disputes through a duel of honor in which the hero could win rightfully, and the loser would die with honor. Thus, this mythicized era romanticized gun violence by perpetuating variations of the same troubling theme: A good guy shoots and defeats the bad guy. This messaging, which closely tied the use of firearms as the determinant of righteousness, cemented the guns' relationship to American heroism.
