        <h1>Fear</h1>
        <p class = "explanation">
       The plot of Security (2017) is cliché and identical to many conventional action movies about redemption. Eddie Deacon, a former Marine Corps Captain, is unable to provide for his family and grows distant from his wife and daughter. To reclaim his loved ones, Eddie takes on a job as a mall security guard. Eddie eventually encounters a girl named Jamie under the witness protection program and protects her against a group of mercenaries. Eddie kills the leader of the mercenaries, saves Jamie, and returns back to his wife and daughter. <br><br>
Eddie, while combating against the many mercenaries, shows off his fighting skills, often double-gunning his enemies down. During fight sequences, Eddie's security buddies are shown shooting out of fear, pulling their guns as a method of self-defense. In the final scene, the mercenary leader (who resembles more of a gang leader) holds Jamie at gunpoint. After a brief interaction, Eddie plants his final bullet in the leader's head and protects Jamie. The movie ends, sending a twisted and convoluted version of the classic message: "protect the ones you love." <br><br>
In a media event after the 2012 Sandy Hooks shooting, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre claimed that “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun” to rationalize arming teachers against school shooters (Overby). Undoubtedly, this solution for school shootings is (a) unrealistic, (b) a safety hazard, and (c) as black-and-white as the Western plots. However, in his claim, LaPierre sells a resonant belief that emphasizes Americans’ desire for individualism and self-protection. We can observe this movement in their reason for gun ownership. In 2019, 63% of gun owners cited that protection was their biggest factor for owning firearms – a sharp 37% increase from responses in 1999 (Why Own). In other words, for more than half of the population, the ownership of guns has reverted to being a necessity. Indeed, the NRA recurrently uses a sentiment of protection to justify their opposition to more restrictive gun control laws. During the period of social unrest in the pandemic, NRA campaigns used fear-mongering tactics to vilify the federal government. On Twitter, they posted a video that encouraged Americans to stockpile guns and protect themselves because “the government [would] not be able to protect them” (NRA). However, they overstate the effectiveness of self-protection. Harvard research shows that, in cases of self-defense, guns are only used in 0.9% of crimes from 2007 to 2011 (Gun Threats). In this light, it is observable that guns act more as a safety blanket rather than as a solution to prevent gun-related crimes. <br><br>
Clearly, guns don’t do their job of protecting that often. Nevertheless, the U.S. purchased nearly 20 million firearms in 2021 (Walsh). And, in 2015, almost half of gun-owners claimed to own three or more guns (Beckatt). This ongoing infatuation of guns and particularly gun collecting indicates that guns are taking on an alternate meaning. In the media, the NRA and other gun lobbyists often praise gun owners as the embodiment of classic American ideals such as family, justice, and protection. Yet, while those values may be resonant to an extent, most gun collectors relish in the gun’s offering of vanity and power. In an article interviewing some of America’s gun ‘super-owners’ (all of whom own more than 20 firearms), many collectors compared their gun collection to collections of jewelry, shoes, or tattoos (Beckatt). Although all the collectors initially began their collection as a precaution against danger, their purchase focus shifted from functionality to admiring a gun’s aesthetics, history, and rarity. Essentially, their collection became a display of luxury and wealth.
