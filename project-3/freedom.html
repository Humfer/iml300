        <h1>Liberation</h1>
        <p class="explanation">
            Guns have been widely considered an essential freedom since our independence. As a result, many have treated firearms with carelessness. In Hollywood, movies flash guns as an accessory for style and a toy. Thomas Pimental, a licensed armorer for films states, “the first thing people do when they see those guns is they try to pick them up” despite displaying many safety warnings on set (Li). On the filming of <i>Rust</i> (2021), actor Alec Baldwin accidentally fired a prop gun, shooting and killing director of photography Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. The accident is clearly a result of insufficient caution toward firearms–even props. Crew members didn’t wear protective gear when firearms were on set. One account of the incident alleged that crew members toyed with the props to shoot beer cans. Even the source of the ammunition was unclear. The attitude of limitless freedom on guns has led to chaos. However, gun lobbyists refuse to acknowledge this developed behavior, continuing to blindly push for its easy access. <br><br>
The current political climate continues to push back and forth on implementing gun laws. After switching their motivation of promoting gun safety to protecting gun rights, the NRA has continued to spend millions on influencing gun policy. In 2014, they spent $3.3 million to prevent gun laws from requiring more thorough background checks on gun buyers (US Gun). They and other gun organizations have made claims of Second Amendment and freedom endangerment against any statements in support of gun control law. President Obama, who signed 23 executive actions on gun control after Sandy Hooks, was accused of attempting to impose tyranny and martial law. He even notes that, when he tried to enforce background checks, “it was resisted because the notion was that [he and his team] were going to take [their] guns away” (PBS NewsHour). <br><br>
Consequently, this notion perpetuates America’s high gun violence rate. In the 2020, 79% of U.S. murders involved a firearm. Mass shootings are reported every single day in the U.S. Over half of Americans would consider gun violence to be a very big problem in America. It is clear that both sides of gun control – for and against – are against gun violence. However, gun lobbyists insist on having guns as a part of their identity of freedom, power, and justice. Consequently, lawmakers can’t make sufficient progress in preventing gun violence. The argument that people kill and not guns accuses gun-control advocates of taking away people’s rights and seems irrelevant considering gun lobbyists’ opposition to even background checks and safety training. If we stop portraying in the media stereotypes of the dutiful American with a gun, guns will no longer act as a safety blanket against danger and judgment. If we stop valuing guns so much in our identity, we may see a shift in our gun control laws.
