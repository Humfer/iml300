        <p class = "explanation"> A popular franchise in the 1990s, <i>Rambo</i> follows the adventures of John Rambo, a Vietnam War veteran and former prisoner of war (POW). The franchise is essentially created as one incoherent male fantasy. It features a fetization of the male body. Rambo, played by Sylvester Stallone, appears unkempt, bronze, glossy, and often shirtless. The movies cater to the male gaze through themes of heroism and an idealistic portrayal of masculinity. <br><br>
            In <i>Rambo: First Blood: Part II</i> (1982), Rambo single-handedly fights against Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers, all while trying to save other POWs in Vietnam. Disregarding the fights' violent messages against Asians and non-Americans, Rambo’s heroism is coded in masculine imagery, advertising stereotypical values such as vigilantism and individualism. Rambo uses an extravagant firearm: the M60 General-Purpose Machine Gun (also called "The Pig''). The machine gun is hefty and can fire 200 rounds per minute - a clear indication that this gun operates as intimidation. Through its use, we can see how the gun becomes a phallic symbol that secures the male power status. <br><br>

            A 2019 study about American gun culture found that white respondents (the largest demographic of gun-owners) who were economically distressed were more likely to derive self-esteem and moral rectitude from their weapons (Menken 3). In this way, we can see how guns give their owner a height of status and power that is similar to Rambo's. For the empowered gun owner, guns convey a false sense of control, superiority, and invincibility. This drastic shift from protection to power is indeed dangerous, especially because 48% of gun owners who feel empowered by guns also justify violence against the federal government (Menken 16). <br> <br>
            
            The media’s failure to acknowledge this twisted result of gun culture is caused by our reluctance to depart from guns. The current political climate continues to push back and forth on implementing gun laws. After switching their motivation of promoting gun safety to protecting gun rights, the NRA has continued to spend millions on influencing gun policy. In 2014, they spent $3.3 million to prevent gun laws from requiring more thorough background checks on gun buyers (US Gun). They and other gun organizations have made claims of Second Amendment and freedom endangerment against any statements in support of gun control law. After signing 23 executive actions on gun control after Sandy Hooks, President Obama was accused of attempting to impose tyranny and martial law. He notes that, when he tried to enforce background checks, “it was resisted because the notion was that [he and his team] were going to take [their] guns away” (PBS NewsHour).
